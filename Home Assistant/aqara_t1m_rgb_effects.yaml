## Fading:
##  Colors fade in and out, creating a gentle pulsing effect between colors.
##
## Hopping:
##  Colors jump/switch instantly between colors with no transition.
##
## Breathing:
##  Colors pulse like breathing - getting brighter then dimmer rhythmically.
##
## Rolling:
##  Colors rotate around the ring in a spinning motion.
##
## Stopping Effects:
## - Click the **Stop Effects** button to turn off the dynamic effect, or
## - Click any static preset button, or
